const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'How does JobBlitz auto-apply to jobs?',
    answer:
      'JobBlitz scans 500,000+ company career pages daily for new postings that match your preferences. When a match is found, it fills and submits the application form using your profile — exactly like a manual application, just done automatically at scale.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will employers know my application was automated?',
    answer:
      'No. Applications are submitted through standard application flows, indistinguishable from a manual submission. Employers see a normal, complete, personalised application.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I control which jobs JobBlitz applies to?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Set job titles, locations, salary range, seniority level, and specific companies to include or exclude. You can also switch to manual review mode to approve each application before it goes out.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What results can I realistically expect?',
    answer:
      'Users typically see 3× more interview invitations compared to manual applications. Results vary by role and market, but the analytics dashboard helps you continuously optimise — you can A/B test resumes and track which job titles get the most responses.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long until I start getting interviews?',
    answer:
      "61% of users report receiving an interview request within their first 10 days. The more accurately you configure your preferences, the faster you'll see results.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a free plan?',
    answer:
      'Yes — the Free plan gives you 5 auto-applications per day, a basic job tracker, and 1 resume profile. No credit card required to get started.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I cancel my subscription anytime?',
    answer:
      'Yes — no contracts, no lock-ins. Cancel anytime from your billing settings. You retain access until the end of your current billing period. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my resume and personal data safe?',
    answer:
      "Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We never sell your data to third parties. Your information is used solely to run your job search — that's a promise.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you share my data with employers?',
    answer:
      'Only the information included in your application (resume, cover letter, answers) is shared with employers — nothing else. We never share your account activity, browsing data, or analytics with any third party without your explicit consent.',
  },
